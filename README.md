The code provided simulates a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) graph over a 24-hour period, including fluctuations that resemble real-life glucose patterns. The plot shows the glucose levels, with a target range between 70 and 180 mg/dl, and boundary exceedances (values below 70 mg/dl and above 180 mg/dl) highlighted.

Spikes occur after meal times (at 7 AM, 12 PM, and 6 PM) to simulate post-meal glucose increases.
Dips are added around 3 AM and 3 PM to represent periods of low glucose, like overnight and in the afternoon.
Boundary Exceedances: A dip below 70 mg/dl at 5 AM and a spike above 180 mg/dl at 7 PM are deliberately introduced to highlight periods outside the recommended target range.
